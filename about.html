<div class="about_head">
    <p>Hey, my name is Alan Rubin, born in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil and currently living in Israel, married, father of 2 beautiful children and working as a developer consultant in different challenging projects.</p>

    <p>I’m currently focused and interested in end to end research, design and development of web products, that includes User Interface client side to server side developments. At UI side, I’m currently working (and playing) with Javascript and libraries for developing and integrating web 2.0 desktop and mobile technologies (jQuery, Prototype, Scriptaculous, Sencha Touch) with emphasis at cool interfaces using css3 and HTML5 that can provide high standards of user interaction and usability. In the mobile world, I like the Phonegap approach and I'm happy writing plugins for it, specially for iOS (with some ObjectiveC salt).</p>
		
	<p>Server side speaking, I’m currently very skilled in Java and Ruby/Rails (after working with different languages such as C++, PHP) and loving to research and develop with dynamic languages, specially with the nice Ruby language with some Rails sauce. As a former employee of SAP Labs, I have also some experience on its products and technologies.</p>

    <p>It is important for me to work in an open-minded, agile and dynamic environment, together with good people (both technically and personally). This environment must values quality and simple solutions and delivers customer oriented products. Agile is really a must (and not just a buzzword): there is no time for waste – throw unimportant things out or developers won’t survive.</p>

    <p>Academic speaking, I hold a B.Sc. at Computers and Electronics Engineering (Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil) and  almost a M.Sc. at Computer Science (Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Israel).</p>

    <p>Entrepreneurial speaking, I’m very interested at startups and ideas that may turn into startups. I have many ideas that I would be happy to share (and implement!).</p>

    <p>If you are interesting in contacting me, please feel free to send me an email – alan at frubin dot com.</p>
