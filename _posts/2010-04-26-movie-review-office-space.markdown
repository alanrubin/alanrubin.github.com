Some weeks ago, I have watched the old but nice movie "<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0151804/" target="_blank">Office Space</a>". A brief synopsis from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_Space">wikipedia</a>: "<em><strong>Office Space</strong></em> is a 1999 American comedy film written and  directed by Mike Judge. It satirizes work life in a typical  1990s software company,  focusing on a handful of individuals who are fed up with their jobs. The film's sympathetic portrayal of ordinary IT workers garnered it a cult  following among those in that profession, but the film also addresses  themes familiar to office workers and white collar employees in general."

Briefly, the movie displays nicely a high-tech work environment from the 90's. Sadly, some of the points presented there are still being adopted at today's high-tech working environments. I wrote some of them down here with my personal comments so you can get a feeling on what to expect from the movie.
<ul>
	<li> Only you know about your business: Do not hire external consultants, it is normally a waste of time and money. Use your own internal staff force - you must trust on them.</li>
	<li>Eliminate work waste : T.P.S. reports (watch the movie to understand) are never read by anybody. You must be efficient.</li>
	<li>Over-management is evil: How many manager must come and say you the same thing ? (or worst : say you different things)</li>
	<li>Last one: Relax - work is important but you must get a life ! There is a nice phrase for that: some people live to work but you should work to live. Normal people only can make a good work if they have a life.</li>
</ul>
In summary, although the movie is a bit old, I recommend you to check it out.
