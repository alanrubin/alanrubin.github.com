description: Alan Rubin comes back after a long break and talks about professional changes in his life

Ok, so here I am back again after [my last post](http://blog.therubinway.com/2010/04/26/movie-review-office-space/) an year ago... I know I have broken some promises I made to you and to myself but now is time to start again a new path. I have convinced myself that it is totally necessary to write a blog as I have many interest thoughts and projects to share with you.

Since my last post, many things have changed. The first and biggest one is that I have moved professionally from being a JAVA developer to a client side javascript and a [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/) dev. 

For some time in the past I have been looking into Rails and trying to work on it on my spare time but since last year it is official: I'm working with it and JS 100% in [SAP Labs](http://www.sap.com/corporate-en/our-company/innovation/saplabs/israel/index.epx). I started working with [Prototype.js](http://www.prototypejs.org/) and [Scriptaculous](http://script.aculo.us/) (still with a JAVA backend) in [BOE BIW Aurora](http://biguru.wordpress.com/2011/05/20/what%E2%80%99s-new-in-sap-businessobjects-enterprise-bi-4-0-platform-or-boxi-4-0-aka-aurora/) for some months, and since last year I'm part of the core Enterprise Workspaces OnDemand team, doing cool things with [jQuery](http://jquery.com/) / [jQuery UI](http://jqueryui.com/) and [JRuby](http://www.jruby.org/) on Rails in the backend. You can get a sneak preview from my work by registering free and accessing the dashboard tab in the [BI OnDemand](http://www.ondemand.com/businessintelligence) project or watching an old version video below.

JAVA guys, don't take it badly... but it is hard to me to enjoy JAVA coding (although I have much experience on it). Rails and Ruby make my developments so efficient due to different reasons that it is very hard to think about using something else.

So, again, I'm back with this blog. Along with my technical thoughts, I will publish also some nice technical tips and the projects I have been doing. Keep connected. I hope you will enjoy it.
