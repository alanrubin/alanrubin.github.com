Some weeks ago I have attended a FLEX course in the framework of my job. I have observed for the last months an increase interest in using FLEX in the corporate products developed at my current company. Although I have observed that FLEX has some advantages, such as rapid development, fast learning-curve (at least for me - an experienced JAVA developer) and ubiquitous presence in almost every computer OS, there are indeed other concerns that make me worried about the its adoption - its seems to me that "corporate" decision makers are not thinking twice when deciding to adopt it.

I have to admit that although I like a lot learning different programming languages and frameworks, I found it very hard to  find FLEX interesting - for some different reasons...

First because it makes extensive use of XML - don't mistake me - there some times where the use of it is justified but still I think it is overused in FLEX (mainly because of the native support for it in ActionScript). The thruth is that this can possibly be a subject of a separate post.

Second reason is that I have an impression that it is targeted for the Java developers audience - the Actionscript language looks very similar indeed and also the main dev environment (FLEX builder) is build above Eclipse. This shouldn't be a problem, you can ask, but after working with dynamic language such as javascript and ruby, I think that Java and its friends just lack the flexibility that is needed for day to day agile development - guys we need instant feedback and lean dev tools!!!.

Another reason is connected to the launch of Apple's iPad and the future of FLEX. After reading different opinions, I got the impression that FLEX is indeed lacking future as it is not supported at all in the majority of mobile devices being used worldwide (read iPhone) @update : It seems it won't be supported also in the <a href="http://technorati.com/technology/article/flash-wont-appear-in-newest-windows/">upcoming Windows Mobile</a> at least in the beginning.

Finally, also related to the last idea, is the current usage of FLEX : Almost every application of FLEX in the web I can think about today is related to video, charts, advertisement and games. Can you think some place where it is used in forms, for example ? I don't. And for the above usages, I think the most important ones (at least for user's point of view) are the video and chart capabilities. And this also is beginning to be provided (although slowly) with the HTML5 reference standard.

So, you think using FLEX in you corporate application - please think again ! Standards are welcomed.
