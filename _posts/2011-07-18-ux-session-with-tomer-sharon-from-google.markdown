---                              
Yesterday I had the pleasure to attend my first session of the [Lean Startup Israel group](http://www.meetup.com/lean-startup-israel/). By definition, the Lean Startup group "focus on the business aspects of startup and the various implications". In this session, [Tomer Sharon](http://about.me/tsharon), UX Researcher at [Google US](http://www.google.com), was invited to discuss and answer questions on different UX topics in a forum mediated by [Guy Nirpaz](http://www.linkedin.com/in/guynirpaz), co-founder and CEO at [Totango](http://www.totango.com/). 

Although I'm (still) not a startup founder, I have become more and more interested in UX topics lately, mainly because my work as a front end developer. It took place at [Outbrain's office](http://www.outbrain.com/) in Netanya, Israel. People that attended the session were mainly founders and co-founders of different startups and the topics discussed there were very interesting, even from a developer perspective. I will try summarize below the main subjects of the session.

[Tomer](http://about.me/tsharon) started the session by showing us a funny video (still do not have the link, sorry) about usability tests in Google. After that, he talked about different topics:

* What is [User eXperience](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_experience) ? There are many definitions, and UX is not a new topic. It does not relies only on software, UX can affect everything, from computers to clothes.

* The first advice for good UX: "Get out of the building" by [Steve Blank](http://steveblank.com/) , i.e., it is very important that you go to the field and understand your users

* Understand your users does not mean to ask them what they would do; actually it is proved that most of the time they will do the opposite of what they say. You have to see them in action - do not ask them directly.

* If the only way available to you is to ask users, then your approach should be to inquiry them about some bad experience from the near past.

* Regarding Usability tests...
  
  [Tomer](http://about.me/tsharon) stated that they are the key element for improving UX. Watch users working. Try to understand user actions alone - but you can also ask them to explain.                 
  
  It can be done earlier or later in a product development. It does not need to be done using real software, it can be done using a mockup, powerpoint or even paper and pencil. 
  
  It can be done once a week in order to improve your product flow continuously. It can also be done for a simple flow or concept. Ask users to think aloud.
  
  It does not need to be promoted by UX experts, it can be done by anybody, although [Tomer](http://about.me/tsharon) does not recommend that developers test their own baby project. It is important that real users will do the test. Also sites as [usertesting.com](http://www.usertesting.com/) are problematic, as it turns out that testers become professional UX testers and do not reflect the real user behavior.

* Do not fool yourself: the improvement of the UX never ends. It is a continuous process, where it is almost impossible to figure out and fix all issues, but still it is very important to identify and fix the main ones.

* How does google improves UX ? By using many usability test technics, such as online tests (which cost a lot of money) and instrumentation of user behavior on existing applications.

* There are hundreds of metrics for good web UX. [Tomer](http://about.me/tsharon) talked about first click, bounce rate and others.

* Good UX does not rely only on UX Researchers: it is also relies on good design, good technologic decisions, good product management and many other factors.

Finally, [Tomer](http://about.me/tsharon) recommended four (thin!) books for UX improvement - those books are a good match for all types of people, from developers to founders:

* [100 Things Every Designer Needs to Know About People](http://www.amazon.com/Things-Designer-People-Voices-Matter/dp/0321767535) by Susan Weinschenk 
* [Rocket Surgery Made Easy: The Do-It-Yourself Guide to Finding and Fixing Usability Problems](http://www.amazon.com/Rocket-Surgery-Made-Easy-Yourself/dp/0321657292) by Steve Krug
* [Simple and Usable Web, Mobile, and Interaction Design](http://www.amazon.com/Simple-Usable-Mobile-Interaction-Design/dp/0321703545) by Giles Colborne
* [Undercover User Experience Design](http://www.amazon.com/Undercover-Experience-Design-Voices-Matter/dp/0321719905) by Cennydd Bowles and James Box

That's it ! The session was very valuable, I would like to thank the Lean Startup guys and [Tomer Sharon](http://about.me/tsharon) for the great opportunity. 

The session was recorded, so I will update this blog whenever the video becomes available. I will be looking forward to read the recommended books and I hope to keep this blog updated with future UX opportunities such as yesterday's.
