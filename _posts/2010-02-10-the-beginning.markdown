It has been a long time since I have decided to start a blog, but only now I had enough courage and time to write something. I'm a very eager blog reader, and I think I have much to say to the world (it doesn't matter to me how many people will listen to it) and this blog is a way to express myself. Inspired by other blog posts such as <a href="http://thoughtadrian.blogspot.com/2009/06/why-blog.html">this</a> I have decide to start writing.

First let me introduce myself briefly, my name is Alan Rubin, I'm a software enthusiast and developer current living in Israel. If you are more interested about me, please visit <a href="http://blog.therubinway.com/about/">my about page</a>.

In this blog, I will try to focus on the slogan above "Personal thoughts on software &amp; technology", which is to talk personally with you about topics that I find interesting in the software and technology world.Â  From my long experience as a blog reader, I will establish some rules that I think are important for a good blog, as follows:

- Update it frequently : My starting goal is to update it once every two weeks at least.

- Short posts : You don't have to spend too much time reading (and I don't spend too much time writing also :)).

- Avoid tech tips : I will try to avoid publish too much tech tips - I will try to focus on tech thoughts.

- Focus : Sorry but only tech topics, no personal thing.

- Resources : Always mention my resources so you can get directly to it.

- Direct communication : I will treat you directly - no formalisms.

The last wish: if you will read this blog, please ignore my English mistakes... as a guy coming from a Portuguese and Hebrew background, you can expect from me some issues with the English language.

Hope you enjoy !!!
