After spending 4 days in a basic javascript course provided by my company, I was wondering if it was really needed. Fast conclusion: Although the instructor was nice and professional, for me it was mainly a waste of time. At least I got some time to read the nice <a href="http://37signals.com/rework/">REWORK</a> book and to update my blog posts together with refreshing some of the basics of javascript.

Being nice, I can say that the <strong>majority of people that come to courses are lazy</strong> - they can learn by themselves in the Internet or books and it will be much more effective instead of going to some static course presented by some external instructor.

I feel that the main (and maybe unique) added value for course is learning the real world experiences from the instructor. In specific cases where information about some specific subject is difficult to find, a course also can be valuable. But for learning basic and widely known subjects, it is really a waste of time and money.

Let me propose something instead : why not distribute specific topics between developers and let them present about it in a lean format (30 mins.)? This will force them to learn more about each subject still maintaing the context focus of the project so they can apply the knowledge in they day to day work.

So do me a favor, don't be lazy waiting for a course - go and learn by yourself.
