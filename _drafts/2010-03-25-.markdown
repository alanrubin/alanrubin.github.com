Talk with Nati, we he asked tips of an AJAX student application. I feel that I know a lot, which is something that rarely happens.

When looking a dev super starts and listen to them in the internet, I feel that I don't know anything

Morale:

1) You must learn from everybody - and this demands (humildade)

2) You need to value yourself sometimes - man this is good !
